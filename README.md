📊 Student MLE Mini-Projects
Welcome to the Student MLE (Machine Learning Engineer) Mini-Project Series! This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects created using Google Colab as part of a student-focused learning journey in machine learning, data science, and MLOps.

Each notebook explores a core concept or technique, with practical implementation using Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and TensorFlow.

📁 Projects Overview
Project	Description
1. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)	Initial data exploration including statistical summaries, missing value handling, and visualizations.
2. Logistic Regression	Binary classification using logistic regression, model evaluation using accuracy, ROC, and confusion matrix.
3. Trees and Forests	Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers applied to structured data. Feature importance analysis included.
4. Deep Learning	Introductory neural network using TensorFlow/Keras for classification tasks.
5. Recommendation Engines	Collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation systems.
6. Fine Tuning	Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and model optimization techniques.
7. Machine Learning Pipeline	Full ML pipeline from preprocessing to model evaluation with automation.
8. Flask API Deployment	Hosting an ML model using a simple Flask web app, showing MLOps deployment basics.

🚀 Getting Started
You can run each notebook via Google Colab with no local setup required:

Click on any .ipynb file.

Open in Colab.

Run cells from top to bottom.

Install required libraries via !pip install if not already installed.

🧰 Requirements
Most projects use:

Python 3.x

pandas, numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib, seaborn

TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning)

Flask (for deployment notebook)

📌 Notes
These notebooks were created and tested in Google Colab.

Some files are prefixed with Copy_of_ because they originated from shared templates or earlier student edits.
